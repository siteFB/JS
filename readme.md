$\mathcal{\color{purple}{ \ JavaScript \ }}$<br>

JavaScript is object-oriented and runs on the browser side, but it can also be used on the server side.
<br>
I selected 1 library and 2 frameworks for browser, and 1 framework for server. We will see that we can test an application before deploying it.
<br><br>

# The browser <br>

- The JQuery library is simple to use. You can manipulate the DOM, use it for dialogs, animations, forms...<br>
- The AngularJS framework is the most popular. It is present for e-commerce, real-time applications (like weather, Youtube...)<br>
- Vue.js will be used for user interfaces.
<br><br>

# The server<br>

- Node.js is the easiest to understand, set up and update. Used in communication programs, browser games (Linkedin, Netflix, PayPal...)<br><br>

# Mocha<br>

- For testing in browser and also works on node.js.
